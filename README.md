## About This Site

This site was made with a custom static html generator using jinja2 templates with Python. It serves mostly as a way to share recipes with friends and family, but will also (eventually) be home to some writing. Whether that writing is technical or not, is to be seen. You can view the site at [dippingsauce.net](https://www.dippingsauce.net).

You probably won't want my site, but you probably want to see how I have it set up, and you could use the generator yourself if you wanted.


## TODO
- add reviews
    - viewing
    - filtering
    - individual pages (?) (depends on the size of the reviews)
- add more filtering options for recipes (i.e., search by name, ingredient, etc)
- create space for articles / posts / writing
